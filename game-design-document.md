## Title: Cats of the Rainforest

## High Concept

Cats of the Rainforest is a strategy and tower-defense game where a cat tribe protects a rainforest clearing from masked mice attempting to convert it into monoculture fields. The player gathers resources during the day and defends the forest at night, aiming to survive five enemy waves and preserve the rainforest.

## Genre & Platform

Strategy / Tower Defense

2.5D (2D sprites in a 3D world)

JavaScript

PC

Session length: 10–15 minutes

## Core Loop

Day → Gather and Build → End Day → Night → Defend → Repeat for 5 waves

## Gameplay

### Day Phase (Player-Driven)

The player gathers food and wood from the forest, builds structures and defensive towers, trains cat tribe units using food, and prepares defenses. The player decides when to end the day. More aggressive resource use increases enemy strength at night.

### Night Phase

Masked mice attack from the edges of the rainforest. Their goal is to reach and destroy the Forest Totem. Cat units and towers defend automatically, while the player can move, fight, and use limited abilities. Building and gathering are disabled at night.

## Resources

Food is used to create and maintain cat units.

Wood is used to build structures and towers.

Forest Health affects enemy strength and long-term efficiency.

## Units

### Cat Tribe

Defensive units trained with food that protect paths, buildings, and the Forest Totem. They represent stewardship of the rainforest.

### Mouse Enemies

Masked mice seeking to turn the rainforest into monoculture fields. They focus on environmental destruction and grow stronger and more numerous each wave.

## Objective and Failure

### Win Condition

Survive five night waves. After the fifth wave, the rainforest is secured.

### Lose Condition

The Forest Totem is destroyed.

## Masterpiece

After victory, the UI is hidden and the camera frames the entire map. The final state of the rainforest is automatically screenshotted, creating a unique piece of artwork representing the player’s journey.

## Visual Style

Stylized rainforest environment with a randomly selected color palette per run and subtle animations throughout the world.

## Theme Alignment

Outgrow Hunger: balancing food production and sustainability.

All in for Nature (Rainforest): protecting a threatened ecosystem.

Masterpiece: the final map is captured as artwork.

Procedural: varied layouts and encounters.

## One-Sentence Pitch

A strategy game where a cat tribe defends the rainforest from masked mice seeking to create monoculture fields, balancing resources and defense across five nights.
